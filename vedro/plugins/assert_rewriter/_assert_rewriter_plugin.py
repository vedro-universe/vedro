# While assertion rewriting might initially seem like a tricky—or even hacky—
# approach, it is in fact a deliberate and pragmatic solution that delivers
# expressive failure reports without forcing the user into a custom assert API.
#
# 1. Bypassing Python’s Limitations
#    ------------------------------
#    At runtime, Python reduces `assert left OP right` to a Boolean check and,
#    on failure, raises a bare `AssertionError`. The original left/right
#    expressions and the operator are discarded. During module import, the
#    loader amends the abstract-syntax tree (AST) so that this missing
#    meta-information is preserved, implemented in the most straightforward
#    manner possible.
#
# 2. Developer Ergonomics / Experience
#    ---------------------------------
#    Without rewriting, a test author would need to remember helper functions
#    such as `assert_eq()` or `assert_isinstance()`, import them in every file,
#    and wrap each comparison manually—making tests less readable, harder to
#    write, and more tedious to maintain. Rewriting lets the author keep
#    idiomatic asserts, and when one fails, Vedro’s reporters can display a
#    coloured diff of the mismatched values — exactly what developers expect,
#    rather than Python’s cryptic traceback.
#
# 3. Zero Behavioral Impact
#    ----------------------
#    The transformation acts as a compile-time pre-processor that preserves the
#    exact semantics of the original code. It doesn’t alter control flow,
#    introduce side effects, or slow down execution in any measurable way. Its
#    sole purpose is to enrich the resulting `AssertionError` with additional
#    context, so reporters can render precise, readable diffs. In that sense, it
#    is conceptually identical to the miniature AST edits that debugging or
#    coverage tools perform, just laser-focused on assertions.
